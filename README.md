# TipJar

TipJar is a lightweight MegaETH testnet dapp for on-chain tipping. The repo will house a Foundry-based `TipJar.sol` contract, deployment scripts, tests, and a Next.js frontend that streams `Tipped` events in real time.

## 2-Day Build Focus
- Day 1: implement and test the contract, deploy to MegaETH testnet, scaffold Next.js with wallet connect and tipping flow.
- Day 2: wire up WebSocket tip streaming, live stats panels, UI polish, env wiring, and prep for launch/announcement.

Additional docs, contract code, and frontend modules will be added as milestones in the outline are completed.
